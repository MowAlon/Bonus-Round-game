# Bonus Round

Use the keyboard or whatever custom controller you want to protect the Mushroom Kingdom from a never-ending barage of bullets.

Immiately playable at [http://mowalon.github.io/Bonus-Round-game/]

Use Space-J-K-L-; (that's the home row, baby!) to defend with your own bullets, but make sure you don't shoot too fast, or you'll never make it across to the bad guys.

If you need to take a potty break, just tap that '~' button to pause.
